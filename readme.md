```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

### Spotify API Rate Limits

SporlCLI respects Spotify's API rate limits to ensure reliable operation:

- **Rate Limit**: ~100 requests per minute per application
- **Burst Limit**: Temporary higher rates allowed, but sustained high usage is throttled
- **Retry-After**: The tool automatically respects `Retry-After` headers (up to 2 minutes)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Built-in delays between batch operations (30 seconds between artist chunks)

**Impact on Usage**:
- Initial setup for users with many followed artists (500+) may take 15-30 minutes
- Force updates (`--force`) will always take longer than incremental updates
- Large playlist creation operations may have delays between batches

### Account Requirements

#### Basic Functionality
- **Free Spotify Account**: Required for authentication and artist following
- **Followed Artists**: You must follow artists on Spotify for the tool to track their releases
- **API Access**: Requires creating a Spotify Developer App (free)

#### Premium Features
- **Playlist Creation**: Requires Spotify Premium subscription
- **Playlist Modification**: Premium account needed to create/modify playlists
- **Track Previews**: Full track access requires Premium

### Data Limitations

#### Release Data Quality
- **Date Precision**: Only releases with day-precision dates are processed
  - ‚úÖ Included: "2023-10-15" (exact date)
  - ‚ùå Excluded: "2023-10" (month only) or "2023" (year only)
- **Regional Availability**: Some releases may not be available in your market
- **Release Types**: Limited to Spotify's classification (album, single, compilation, appears_on)

#### Historical Data
- **Spotify Limitations**: Cannot fetch releases older than what Spotify provides in artist discography
- **Cache Dependency**: Historical data depends on when you first ran updates
- **No Backfill**: Cannot retroactively get releases from before you followed an artist

### Performance Considerations

#### Initial Setup Time
For reference, typical setup times based on followed artists:
- **< 50 artists**: 2-5 minutes
- **50-200 artists**: 5-15 minutes
- **200-500 artists**: 15-30 minutes
- **500+ artists**: 30+ minutes

#### Storage Requirements
Approximate local storage usage:
- **Artist Cache**: ~1-5 MB (depending on number of followed artists)
- **Release Cache**: ~10-50 MB per year of data
- **Total**: Usually under 100 MB for typical usage

#### Network Usage
- **Initial Update**: ~1-10 MB download (depends on artist count and release volume)
- **Incremental Updates**: ~100 KB - 2 MB per update
- **API Calls**: ~2-5 calls per artist during updates

### Technical Limitations

#### Authentication
- **Token Expiry**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour (automatically refreshed)
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens may rotate and require re-authentication
- **Scope Requirements**: Specific OAuth scopes needed for different features
- **Browser Dependency**: Initial auth requires browser access for OAuth flow

#### Concurrent Usage
- **Single Instance**: Designed for single-user, single-instance usage
- **File Locking**: No protection against concurrent access to cache files
- **State Conflicts**: Running multiple updates simultaneously may cause issues

#### Platform Support
- **Tested Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows 10+
- **ARM Support**: Should work but not extensively tested
- **Container Usage**: Requires special setup for OAuth browser flow

### API Dependencies

#### Spotify Web API
- **Service Availability**: Dependent on Spotify API uptime
- **API Changes**: Breaking changes in Spotify API may require tool updates
- **Feature Deprecation**: Some features may become unavailable if Spotify removes API endpoints

#### Third-Party Dependencies
- **OAuth Flow**: Depends on system browser availability
- **Local Server**: Requires ability to bind to localhost:8080 (configurable)
- **Network Access**: Requires unrestricted HTTPS access to Spotify's APIs

### Known Issues & Workarounds

#### Common Problems

1. **"Too Many Requests" Errors**
   - **Cause**: Hitting rate limits during large updates
   - **Solution**: Tool automatically retries with delays
   - **Workaround**: Use `--force` sparingly, prefer incremental updates

2. **Missing Recent Releases**
   - **Cause**: Spotify may have delays in making new releases available via API
   - **Solution**: Run `sporlcli releases update` periodically
   - **Timing**: New releases typically appear within 24-48 hours

3. **Playlist Creation Failures**
   - **Cause**: Insufficient permissions or non-Premium account
   - **Solution**: Ensure Premium account and proper OAuth scopes
   - **Check**: Verify `playlist-modify-public` and `playlist-modify-private` scopes

4. **Large Artist Collections**
   - **Issue**: Very long initial update times (1000+ artists)
   - **Workaround**: Run initial update during off-peak hours
   - **Alternative**: Consider unfollowing inactive artists to improve performance

#### Browser-Related Issues

1. **OAuth Browser Won't Open**
   - **Manual Solution**: Copy URL from terminal and open manually
   - **SSH/Remote**: Use port forwarding or run auth on local machine

2. **Corporate Networks**
   - **Firewall Issues**: May block Spotify API access
   - **Proxy Problems**: May interfere with OAuth flow
   - **Solution**: Contact IT team for API access allowlist

### Best Practices

#### For Optimal Performance
- Run incremental updates regularly rather than forcing full refreshes
- Update artists monthly, releases weekly
- Use specific release types (`--type album`) instead of `all` when possible
- Set up automated updates during low-usage periods

#### For Reliability
- Monitor cache directory disk space (~100 MB buffer recommended)
- Re-authenticate if experiencing persistent auth errors
- Keep tool updated for latest Spotify API compatibility
- Backup cache files before major version updates

#### For Large Collections
- Consider using release type filters to reduce API calls
- Run updates during off-peak hours to avoid rate limiting
- Use `--previous-weeks` parameter judiciously to limit data fetched
- Monitor network usage if on metered connections

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Organization
```
~/.local/share/sporlcli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artist-releases.json    # Artist-to-releases mapping
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ token.json              # OAuth tokens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ releases/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {week}/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ releases.json   # Weekly release data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state_artists.json     # Update progress tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state_releases.json    # Release update state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                        # Configuration
```

### Release Week System
- Weeks start on Saturday and end on Friday
- Week 1 begins on the Saturday before/on January 1st
- Consistent numbering system for reliable organization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `.env` file supports these variables:

```bash
# Local Server Configuration (Web App Redirect URI)
SERVER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8080

# Spotify API Configuration
SPOTIFY_API_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_API_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_USER_ID=your_spotify_username

# Spotify API Configuration and Endpoints (usually don't need to change)
SPOTIFY_API_REDIRECT_URI=http://${SERVER_ADDRESS}/callback
SPOTIFY_API_AUTH_SCOPE="user-library-read user-follow-read user-read-email user-read-private playlist-modify-private playlist-modify-public playlist-read-private"
SPOTIFY_API_AUTH_URL=https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize
SPOTIFY_API_TOKEN_URL=https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
SPOTIFY_API_URL=https://api.spotify.com/v1
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Release Types
Filter updates by release type:
- `album` - Full-length albums
- `single` - Singles and EPs
- `appears_on` - Compilations and features
- `compilation` - Greatest hits, etc.
- `all` - All types

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Update everything in sequence
sporlcli artists update && sporlcli releases update --type all

# Create playlists for multiple weeks
for week in {1..4}; do
  sporlcli playlist --previous-weeks $week
done
```

### Automation
Set up cron jobs for regular updates:
```bash
# Daily artist check at 9 AM
0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/sporlcli artists update

# Weekly release update on Fridays at 10 AM
0 10 * * 5 /usr/local/bin/sporlcli releases update
